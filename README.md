# talkietalkie
just talk.
Hi, I don't know how to code but I'm trying to make an app called talkie talkie. It lets you talk to people. Maybe even one day animals. I would like to be able to send someone a file in the quickest of the sense. I want to be able to say something to someone. I should be able to thumbs it up or down. We should be able to stack.
